  This site contains climatologies (highs, lows, and averages) for atmospheric and oceanic variables derived from NOAA CO-OPS weather and tide observations. Current sites are updated daily; archived sites are updated less frequently. This project is inspired by Brian McNoldy at the University of Miami, whose long-standing “Climatology of Virginia Key, FL” site never ceased to provide insightful weather perspectives during my time at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science.
