## Oceanic and atmospheric averages and records

This site presents daily and monthly averages and records of NOAA CO-OPS weather and tide observations at different locations along the U.S. East Coast. Current sites are updated daily; archived sites are updated less frequently. This project is inspired by Brian McNoldy at the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/), whose long-standing “Climatology of Virginia Key, FL” site never ceased to provide insightful weather perspectives during my time at the [Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science](Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science).
